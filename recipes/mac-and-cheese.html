    <p class="description">Quick, easy, and tasy. Fancy, designer mac and cheese can cost upwards of $50 to make one batch because of expensive exotic cheeses.</p> 
    <p class="description">But they arent always the best tasting. This simple recipe is cheap and tasty.</p>
    <h3 class="ingredients head">Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li class="ingredients">1 (8 ounce) box elbow macaroni</li>
        <li class="ingredients">1/4 cup butter</li>
        <li class="ingredients">1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li class="ingredients">1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li class="ingredients">ground pepper to taste</li>
        <li class="ingredients">2 cups milk</li>
        <li class="ingredients">2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
    <h3 class="directions head">Directions:</h3>
    <ol class="directions">
        <li>Boil Macaroni:</li>
        <p>Bring a pot of water to a boil. Cook the elbow macaroni al dente, about 8 minutes</p>
        <p>Tip: For thicker mac and cheese, double the amount of macaroni pasta.</p>
        <li>Make Roux:</li>
        <p>While the macaroni is cooking, go ahead and start on the roux. A roux is a thickening agent made up of one part fat and one part flour that makes the base of this thick and creamy mac and cheese.</p>
        <p>To make the roux, start by melting butter in a saucepan over medim heat. Add flour, salt, and pepper and stir until smooth. Slowly pour in milk and stir until the mixture is smooth and bubbling. be careful not to let the milk burn.</p>
        <li>Add Cheese and Macaroni:</li>
        <p>Finally, the most crucial step. Add cheese! Slowly stir in Cheddar cheese until smooth and melted. We reccomend you grate your own cheese because pre-shredded cheese wont incorporate into the mixture as well as blc cheese.</p>
        <p>Once the macaroni is finished cooking, drain and stir into cheese sauce until coated.</p>
